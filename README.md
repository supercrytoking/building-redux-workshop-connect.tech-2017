## Starting an Exercise
Exercises can be found in the `./exercises` directory and has an accompanying solution located in `./exercises-final`. Instructions for each exercise can be found in the exercise's `README.md` file; located in the root of the exercise directory. Exercises consist of a set of failing tests. These tests, combined with the slide deck, will guide you through the concepts and implementation.

## Running Exercise Tests
Run an exercise's test by executing the following command in your console: `npm test n` where `n` is the exercise number. So for example, running exercise 2, the command would be: `npm test 2`.

**GOTCHA**: Do not prefix the exercise number with a "0". This is done for each exercise directory solely for the purpose of listing them in numerical order within your OS/IDE.

## Running Solution Tests
Run an exercise's solution tests by appending `final` to the end of the CLI command. Example for running exercise 1's solution tests: `npm run test 1 final`.
